# Roadmap

- Evaluate adding BLAKE3 support once a stable Go implementation with permissive licensing is available.
- Expand CI coverage with nightly `govulncheck` and dependency diff reports surfaced in the advisory dashboard.
- Formalise contributor onboarding by documenting review SLAs and backup maintainers in [docs/governance.md](governance.md).
