# Contributing

Thanks for investing time in improving this module! Pair this workflow guide with the technical guidance in [docs/architecture_and_guidelines.md](../docs/architecture_and_guidelines.md) and the security rationale in [docs/security_model.md](../docs/security_model.md).

## 1. Before You Start

- Review the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Participating implies acceptance of its terms.
- Search existing [issues](https://github.com/bytemare/hash/issues) and pull requests to avoid duplicating work. For substantial or breaking changes, open an issue first so we can agree on scope.
- Familiarize yourself with the architecture and testing expectations in the documents linked above.

## 2. Development Environment

- One of the three latest Go versions (CI runs the current stable toolchain and the two previous releases).
- `git`, `make`, and a POSIX-compatible shell.
- Optional tools used by CI (installed automatically in workflows but helpful locally): `golangci-lint`, `govulncheck`, and other tooling you can install with `make update-linters`.

## 3. Workflow and Branching

1. Fork the repository and create topic branches from `main` (for example `feat/curve25519-support`, `docs/security-refresh`).
2. Keep changes focused. Separate refactors, dependency bumps, and feature work into distinct pull requests.
3. Reference related issues in your branch description or pull request.

## 4. Commit Standards

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear history (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:` and so on).
- Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` trailer to satisfy the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). Use `git commit -s` to add it automatically.
- Commit only what you have built and tested locally. Avoid large unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Sign your commits using GPG or SSH.

## 5. Quality Checks

1. Run the paved commands before pushing:
  ```bash
  make -C .github lint vulncheck test cover fuzz
  ```
  These targets mirror the CI tests (golangci-lint, `go test`, fuzzing, `govulncheck`, etc.).
2. Ensure `go mod tidy` produces no diff and that coverage does not regress meaningfully. If coverage drops, explain why in the pull request.
3. Update documentation when behaviour or APIs change. Architecture or security changes should be reflected in the relevant `docs/` files.
4. **For user-facing changes**, add an entry to [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) under `[Unreleased]` describing what changed.

## 6. Opening a Pull Request

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`.
2. Fill out the pull request template, including the commands you ran and any follow-up tasks.
3. Keep the description focused on why the change is necessary and what risks were considered. Link issues or discussions for additional context.
4. If the change affects documentation, link to the updated files in the PR body so reviewers can verify rendering quickly.

## 7. Review Expectations

- Expect at least one maintainer review. Response times are usually within a few business days. Comment if you need a quicker turnaround.
- Be responsive to feedback. If discussion stalls, summarise remaining concerns so the maintainer can make a decision.
- Maintainers may close stale PRs after reasonable attempts to coordinate.

## 8. Issue Guidance

- Include reproduction steps, expected versus actual behaviour, and environment details (Go version, OS/arch).
- For vulnerabilities, follow the process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) rather than opening a public issue.
- Feature requests should describe the use case and, when possible, sketch the desired API.

## 9. Releases and Post-Merge Tasks

- Maintainers follow the process in [docs/releasing.md](../docs/releasing.md). Contributors assisting with release notes should provide changelog entries and highlight migration steps.
- After a change lands, watch for CI status and respond quickly if regressions are reported by downstream users.
